Steps for installation/ setup:
1) Be awesome. 
2) Create a project file in your IDE/Compiler. 
3) After you create the project then copy over the library files from the Github repository and paste them to the project folder that you are working from. 
4) Once the files have been copied over into that folder you can go in and edit the compiler settings, linker settings and directory settings.
